# Modeling Deaths for Diabetes & Kidney Diseases, Globally

### Data Science Project Overview

In school I had the opportunity to take a data science elective. I was exposed to new concepts like models, linear ression, and validation. Fortunately, my teammates, experienced in data science, shared their knowledge. On the flip side, my skills in R programming surpassed theirs, especially in normalizing data for a relational database.

Our goal was to predict global death rates for diabetes and kidney diseases. The real challenge was finding a suitable dataset amidst complexities like changing country names and recording intervals. My past experience in database management came in handy. Combining three datasets into a single SQLite database with lookup tables for location and year kept data retrieval for our models easy and consistent across the team.

Iterations were inevitableâ€”refining the database, adjusting models. But each iteration was releaseed as a new database version, and we just had to make sure we were using the same version for our calculation. It was a good practical application of my past database knowledge to the world of data science.

### Summary

**Modeling Deaths for Diabetes & Kidney Diseases, Globally**
Authors: Shreyas Dikshit, Amare Diotte, Tay Goodwin, Aditi Gupta


This project provides valuable insights into future death rates for diabetes and kidney diseases in various countries. By leveraging historically available data and implementing a machine learning model, we aimed to predict death rates for specific years (e.g., 2019) based on prior data (e.g., 2010 or 2015).

The model's evaluation against actual death rates for the target year allowed iterative improvements, ensuring a reduction in prediction errors. The results offer significant meaning and impact, emphasizing the importance of preventive healthcare measures and the need to enhance healthcare infrastructure. Key influential factors, such as government health expenditure, a country's GDP, and access to technology and sanitation facilities, were identified through the analysis.

This project showcases the synergy between computer science and data science, illustrating our ability to predict future death rates and provide valuable insights into global health dynamics.
